    <h2>Source code & Issues</h2>

    <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
        I recommend <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro">'Anonymous Pro'</a> as a coding font, because its readable and fixed width.<br>
        This program was made because I didn't like the program (<a href="http://www.rigelcorp.com/reads51.htm">Reads51</a>) we used in school.<br>
        The syntax highlighting was made possible because of a include file made by Roggemans M. (MGM), a teacher of mine.<br>
        The school in question is <a href="http://www.thomasmore.be/english/campus-de-nayer">Thomas More, Campus De Nayer</a>
